<!-- TODO(v2): Move this content back to README.md when v2 is released -->

> **Important: this documents v2 of the SDK, which is in alpha.** Pre-releases are published to PyPI as `2.0.0aN`, and each alpha may contain breaking changes from the previous one.
>
> v2 is a major rework of the SDK, both to support the [2026-07-28 MCP specification release](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/) and to fix long-standing architectural issues. See the [migration guide](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/migration/) for what's changed. We're targeting a beta on 2026-06-30 and a stable v2 on 2026-07-27, alongside the spec release. Before stable, we plan to add a significant set of backwards compatibility shims so the final upgrade is much smaller than today's diff.
>
> **v1.x is the only stable release line and remains recommended for production.** It is in maintenance mode and continues to receive critical bug fixes and security patches. Installers never select a pre-release unless you opt in (for example `pip install mcp==2.0.0a3`), so existing installs are unaffected. **If your package depends on `mcp`, add a `<2` upper bound to your version constraint (for example `mcp>=1.27,<2`) before the stable release lands.**
>
> Try the alpha and tell us what breaks: [#python-sdk-dev on the MCP Contributors Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX). For v1 documentation, see [the v1.x README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/v1.x/README.md).

## Documentation

**The documentation lives at <https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/>.**

It has the full [tutorial](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/tutorial/), the [API reference](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/api/mcp/), and the [migration guide](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/migration/).

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but designed for LLM interactions. With this SDK you can:

- **Build MCP servers** that expose tools, resources, and prompts to any MCP host
- **Build MCP clients** that connect to any MCP server
- Speak every standard transport: stdio, Streamable HTTP, and SSE

## Requirements

Python 3.10+.

## Installation

```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]==2.0.0a3"          # or: pip install "mcp[cli]==2.0.0a3"
```

The pin matters while v2 is in pre-release: an unpinned install resolves to the latest stable v1.x, which this README does not describe. Check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/#history) for the newest pre-release, and use `uv run --with "mcp==2.0.0a3"` for one-off commands.

## A server in 15 lines

Create a `server.py`:

<!-- snippet-source docs_src/index/tutorial001.py -->
```python
from mcp.server import MCPServer

mcp = MCPServer("Demo")


@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""
    return a + b


@mcp.resource("greeting://{name}")
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet someone by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

_Full example: [docs_src/index/tutorial001.py](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/blob/main/docs_src/index/tutorial001.py)_
<!-- /snippet-source -->

That's a complete MCP server: one tool, one templated resource. Open it in the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
uv run mcp dev server.py
```

Call `add` with `a=1`, `b=2` and you get `3` back.

Notice what you did **not** write: no JSON Schema (`a: int, b: int` _is_ the schema), no request parsing, no validation code, no protocol handling. Two type-hinted Python functions and a docstring.

[The tutorial](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/v2/tutorial/) takes it from here.

## A client in 10 lines

The same package is a full MCP **client**. `Client` connects to a URL, a stdio subprocess, a custom transport, or (for tests) straight to a server object in memory with no transport at all:

```python
import asyncio

from mcp import Client

from server import mcp


async def main() -> None:
    async with Client(mcp) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 1, "b": 2})
        print(result.structured_content)  # {'result': 3}


asyncio.run(main())
```

Swap `mcp` for `"http://localhost:8000/mcp"` and the exact same code talks to a remote server.
