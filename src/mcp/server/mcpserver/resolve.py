"""Resolver dependency injection for MCPServer tools.

A tool parameter annotated `Annotated[T, Resolve(fn)]` is filled by running the
resolver `fn` before the tool body, instead of from the LLM-supplied arguments.
Resolvers form a DAG: a resolver may declare its own `Resolve(...)` dependencies,
take tool arguments by name, and take the `Context`. A resolver may return
`Elicit[T]` to ask the client; the framework runs the elicitation and injects the
answer.

The framework picks the elicitation transport from the negotiated protocol. At
>= 2026-07-28 it returns an `InputRequiredResult` carrying the batched questions
and resumes when the client retries with `input_responses`/`request_state`
(independent resolvers are asked in one round; a resolver depending on another's
answer is asked in a later round). At <= 2025-11-25 it issues a synchronous
`elicitation/create` request mid-call. Only *elicited* outcomes are carried in
`request_state` across rounds (so the user is asked each question once); a
resolver that returns a value without eliciting is pure and may re-run each round.

Whether the consumer receives the unwrapped model or the full
`ElicitationResult` union is decided by the consumer's annotation:

- `Annotated[T, Resolve(fn)]` -> unwrapped `T`; decline/cancel aborts the call.
- `Annotated[ElicitationResult[T], Resolve(fn)]` (or a specific member) -> the
  full outcome; the consumer branches on accept/decline/cancel.
